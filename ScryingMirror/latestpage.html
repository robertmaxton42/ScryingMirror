<p>Lyra is quite looking forward to her bed; her headache is mostly under control but has still been gently throbbing all day. ... But, well, she does have a job to do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, modern IDEs are much better at stress-testing code than Masses code would indicate; finding the bug that crashed her ADEI and fixing it, along with several similar potentially problematic flaws only takes about ten minutes of realtime.</p>
<p>After that, it's shower - <b>very</b> fancy, the smartfluid picks up all the dust of a long day before running off all in one go, leaving behind clean and well-conditioned skin - and sleep. No worries about dehydration on a Technocracy plane. She'd normally meditate around now, but she's only going to be getting six hours of sleep tonight as it is, it seems.</p>
<p>So instead, she collapses smoothly onto the decadently fluffy bed, closes her curtains, changes into her pajamas...</p>
<p>Hm, let's test that white noise generator she had written up.</p>
<p>And with that silencing the room, a simple mind trick has her out like a light.</p> </div>

<p>Lyra thinks for a moment. While she doesn't dislike working with Lin, while she's just getting started she should try a few different things, learn from a few people.</p>
<p>... Stake-out does nnnot sound very interesting to her. She'll want to learn to do it sometime - but then again, maybe not. She <b>does</b> have computers to do that for her, after all.</p>
<p>At any rate, spending time with Megan is a hands-on active job, so she'll do that. Silently, she nods at Megan, and walks over to her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just to be helpful, she configures her EDE detector (hopefully fixed!) to watch over the company building. It's two-dimensional and her resolution is still awful, but maybe it'll be useful anyway. She texts Anderson a link to her video feed and sets it up to send her a quiet alert if an EDE enters or leaves the building.</p> </div>

<p>You scan through a number of houses, ranging from those that are utterly infested with EDE's to those that are clean. You get a lot of information about Brass City's plans, which appear to be to start a race war, or something along those lines.

<p>The result... isn't as smooth as she'd like. She had to hook her own ADEI into the field to do it, stealing entropy from her <b>own</b> vision to compensate - that'll take time to wear off, and her vision will be blurry for a while. But it does work - a thrumming field that hovers just under the edge of overloading the vans' antennae, a dimensional distortion that extends into the world as a field of awful buzzing static.</p>
<p>There's no way it'll last long - but it might just slow it down enough.</p> </div>

<p>The EDE stumbles, but keeps going. It's moving much faster than a human could have, and combined with it's head start it's uncertain if you're going to get to it before it enters the crowds.</p> </div>

<p>Lyra grits her teeth. Her mind races, her ADEI overclocking, refining her code, eking as much efficiency out of her projector as she can - so fast the heat is burning her from the inside, but she <b>can't let this killer get free</b> -</p>
<p>It's not enough. So she takes the vans up that last notch, melting the antennae for a disorientating pulse of <b>absolute blindness</b> -</p> </div>
